I've left GitHub for GitLab (to outrun Microsoft) - here I only collaborate with those still using GitHub:

https://gitlab.com/Samuel026b.

Otherwise, chess account:

https://lichess.org/@/Sam026. This is my 'main' account, where all further links and information is.

The only programming language I know is Python, and I'm yet only doing simple things with it.
